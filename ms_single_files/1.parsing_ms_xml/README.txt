1.parsestation.py gets the list of MS stations from .xml file (example results have been printed to output.out)
2.splitstring.py formats output.out (example results have been printed to stations.txt)

Proceed to 2.Ntuple_to_hist directory, where stations.txt has been split into cscstations.txt, mdtstations.txt, rpcstations.txt, and tgcstations.txt.
