The .C files in this folder each read in the relevant chamber's station .txt file and loop over the particle gun ntuple grouping hits by station. They generate one histogram per station, where the histogram approximates the eta-phi position of a detector element. The .C files each output a .root file containing that chamber's histograms (see 3.hist_to_coords directory for the .root files generated with the particle gun ntuple myNtuple1.root)
